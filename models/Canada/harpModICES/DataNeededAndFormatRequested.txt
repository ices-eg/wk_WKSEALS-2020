# pregnancy #
#############

Provided as an annual number of female pregnant per age class (4 to 7 years old, then 8+) for a specific year.

Data.frame with 4 columns including respectively
1. Year
2. Age (4 to 8) with 8 including 8+ individuals
3. Total number of individual of the specific age class in the sample (see note below)
4. Nb pregnant

Note: For each sampling year, each age should be indicated (4 to 8), even if there were no animal of this age class sampled in a specific year. In this case, indicate NA in the columns 3 and 4 (i.e. total and nb pregnant)  
Value for years with missing data will be estimated by a smoother applied on provided values (see model code Line 43, 44 [degoffree, nearestn] controling the smoothing factor)

##################
# pup production #
##################

Vector giving the number of pup produced each year (generally estimated from aerial surveys). Indicate NA for years with missing data

# pup production Standard error #

Vector of value corresponding to the standard errors around the estimated pup production numbers

# initial population vector #

Vector giving the number of individuals in each age classes (26 ages classes including number of newborns as the first element of the vector)

############
# removals #
############


The current version of the model deals with data provided in two files.

The first file includes a data.frame with the following columns: YEAR arctic greenland canpup can1plus by1plus bypup
with
YEAR - each year from 1952 to 2019
arctic - number of animal hunted in the arctic
greenland - number of animals hunted in greenland
canpup - number of pup hunted in Canada
can1plus - number of 1 year old and older animals hunted in Canada
by1plus - number of 1 year old and older animals removed in bycatch
bypup - number of pup remved in bycatch

The other file includes a vector with values corresponding to the proportion of pup in the greenland hunt for each year mentionned in the first file.

Note 1: the proportion of pup in the arctic hunt is considered fixed and defined in the model code.
Note 2: In the code the removals are multiplied by a struck and lost factor that is changing over years

However, the code can be easily modified to deal with a simple data.frame giving the removals in term of number of pup and number of 1+ hunted each year.
So in this case, the input should be a data.frame with three columns (Year, pup removals, 1+ removals)
Struck and Lost factor can be included into the input numbers


###################################
# (optional) Environmental effect #
###################################

Vector of anomalies around a neutral effect (values centered around 1). In the model, this will act on the carrying capacity

# Future predictions #
######################

Struck and Lost factor is hard coded and should be modified/desactivated if needed

Effect of ice coverage (use forecast based on the RCP 4.5 model from IPCC https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polar.2018.11.008) acting on the pup survival. Currently, the effect is null if above a certain threshold and linearly linked to the proportion of sea ice extent.

Future removals from arctic, greenland and bycatch are randomly sampled 
Future canadian removals are given as "Quota" in the model function

The proportion of pup in the removals is hard coded.

Currently pregnancy rates for each age class are sampled from given values (hard coded) but several options are available (need to comment or uncomment the code).
