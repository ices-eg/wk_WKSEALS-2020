### ICES &amp; NAMMCO Joint Workshop on Seal Modelling
Welcome to the GitHub repository for model code and data to be used during the workshop! The basic folder structure is relatively self-explanatory. The models and data directories should contain the models and data to be used. Within each of these, each modelling group/species/country have their own subdirectories where their specific model code or data should be uploaded. Please see the instructions for how to upload data in the document you received via email. This document can also be found in the documents folder in this repository.
