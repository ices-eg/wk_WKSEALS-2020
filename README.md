# ICES &amp; NAMMCO Joint Workshop on Seal Modelling
Welcome to the GitHub repository for model code and data to be used during the workshop! 

The basic folder structure is relatively self-explanatory. The `models` and `data` directories should contain the models and data to be used. Within each of these, each modelling group/species/country (hereafter called units) have their own subdirectories where their specific model code or data should be uploaded. Please see the [instructions](https://github.com/ices-eg/wk_WKSEALS-2020/blob/main/documents/GitHub%20instructions.pdf) for how to upload data in the document you received via email. This document can also be found in the `documents` folder in this repository. The `documents` folder is also where any relevant documents not specific to either of the units can be kept. There is also a `scripts` folder, where various scripts produced during the workshop can be kept. Examples can be various functions created to migrate data between different modelling frameworks.   

For an example of how data and model code can be repressnted in the various unit subdirectories, you can take a look at the `Norway` subdirectories within `models` and `data`.
